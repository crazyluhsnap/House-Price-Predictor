# 🏠 House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices based on various factors like area,
number of rooms, location, and other property features. The goal was to
explore how machine learning models can be used to estimate real estate
prices using historical data.

## 📘 Overview

The notebook walks through the complete process --- from loading the
dataset to visualizing correlations and building a regression model.
It's designed as a beginner-friendly project to understand how data
preprocessing, model training, and evaluation work together.

## ⚙️ Steps Covered

1.  **Importing Libraries** -- Basic setup using pandas, numpy,
    matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn.
2.  **Loading the Dataset** -- Reads and inspects the dataset to
    understand its structure.
3.  **Data Exploration** -- Includes correlation heatmaps, pair plots,
    and statistical summaries to spot relationships between variables.
4.  **Data Preprocessing** -- Handles missing values, normalizes
    features, and splits data into training and testing sets.
5.  **Model Training** -- Uses linear regression to predict house
    prices.
6.  **Model Evaluation** -- Evaluates performance using metrics like R²
    score and mean absolute error.
7.  **Prediction** -- Takes sample input data and predicts the expected
    house price.

## 📊 Visualization

Correlation heatmaps and scatter plots are used to analyze how different
features influence the price.

## 🧠 Tools & Libraries

-   **Python**
-   **NumPy**
-   **Pandas**
-   **Matplotlib**
-   **Seaborn**
-   **Scikit-learn**

## 🚀 Future Improvements

-   Try other models like Decision Tree or Random Forest for
    comparison.
-   Add feature scaling and hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.
-   Deploy the model using a simple web interface.
